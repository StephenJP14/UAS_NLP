Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison.

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\\n\\n### Response:\\n<Summary>Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .\\nU.S consumer advisory group says minimum space must be stipulated .\\nSafety tests conducted on planes with more leg room than airlines offer .\\n<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response[0].split(\"<Summary>\\n\")[1].split(\"\\n<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\")[0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.725030Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.725311Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.730109Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.725288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.729500Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":23,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Emily Carter, 12, helped rescue 78-year-old neighbor from house fire .\\nFirefighters arrived minutes later and extinguished the blaze .\\nEmily was hailed as a hero after saving Mr. Leonard Fields .'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# test_dataset['test'][\"highlights\"]\n\npredictions = []\n\nfor i, text in enumerate(test_dataset['test'][\"article\"][:100]):\n    # Tokenize the input text with a specific prompt format and move it to the GPU\n    inputs = tokenizer([prompt_style.format(text, \"\")], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n    \n    # Generate a response using LoRA fine-tuned model with specific parameters\n    outputs = model_lora.generate(\n        input_ids=inputs.input_ids,          # Tokenized input IDs\n        attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask, # Attention mask for padding handling\n        max_new_tokens=1200,                  # Maximum length for generated response\n        use_cache=True,                        # Enable cache for efficient generation\n    )\n    \n    # Decode the generated response from tokenized format to readable text\n    response = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)\n    \n    # Extract and print only the model's response part after \"### Response:\"\n    result = response[0].split(\"<Summary>\\n\")[1].split(\"\\n<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\")[0]\n    predictions.append(result)\n\n    print(f\"Step {i}: {result}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.731021Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.731311Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-12T18:52:46.972967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-12T18:44:01.731290Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-12T18:52:46.972353Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Step 0: Passengers on a packed plane may face health and safety risks .\nExperts say crowded planes are putting passengers at risk .\nThe U.S Department of Transportation does not set minimum space for humans .\nStep 1: Teenager Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into lions' enclosure in Ahmedabad .\nHe shouted he would 'kill them' and tried to run towards the animals .\nHe fell into a moat and was rescued by zoo security guards .\nStep 2: Dougie Freedman is on the verge of agreeing a new two-year deal with Nottingham Forest .\nThe Scot has stabilised Forest since replacing Stuart Pearce in February .\nForest made an audacious attempt on the play-off places when Freedman replaced Pearce .\nStep 3: Liverpool are linked with a move for Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto .\nThe Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna says he will leave Fiorentina in the summer .\nNeto was reportedly close to a move to Juventus but his agent says no decision has been made .\nStep 4: Bruce Jenner will break his silence on his gender identity in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer .\nThe former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24 .\nThe interview comes amid growing speculation about his transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February .\nStep 5: Firefighters called out to pig and horse stuck in swimming pools .\nPigwig was rescued using slide boards, strops and lines .\nHorse was rescued using an all-terrain crane .\nStep 6: BBC radio audience figures show that the average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in .\nThe figure is 14 per cent down on a decade earlier when the average was 11.6 hours a week .\nStep 7: John Stamos announced Monday night on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" that Netflix has ordered a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called \"Fuller House.\"\nThe show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J.

Grealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley . At Arsenal, Arsene Wenger changed the attitude completely. He said as professional athletes we had a duty to look after our bodies. Alcohol was described as poison — it slows down your body when it needs to be perfectly tuned. You eat what’s required to refuel, not for pleasure. Of course you still get players who want to enjoy themselves but there has to be a cut-off point. When I see Jack play it’s no surprise that he is full of confidence. He has a big future but he has to make the right choices. That’s how you make sure you are on the back pages, not the front.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\nStep 62: Militants killed, Turkish soldiers wounded in clash .\nTurkish leader says PKK's violence is an attempt

Firefighters arrived minutes later and extinguished the blaze, which officials believe was caused by faulty wiring in the kitchen.\n          “Her quick thinking and courage saved a life,” said Fire Chief Ronald Greene. “Most adults wouldn’t have reacted as bravely as she did.”\n          Mr. Fields was treated for minor smoke inhalation but is expected to make a full recovery. Emily, a sixth grader at Cedarville Middle School, says she wants to become a firefighter when she grows up. “I just did what I thought was right,” she said, smiling shyly.\n          Local officials say they plan to recognize her with a community service award next week.\"\"\"\n\n\n# Tokenize the input text with a specific prompt format and move it to the GPU\ninputs = tokenizer([prompt_style.format(text, \"\")], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\n\n# Generate a response using LoRA fine-tuned model with specific parameters\noutputs = model_testing.generate(\n    input_ids=inputs.input_ids,          # Tokenized input IDs\n    attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask, # Attention mask for padding handling\n    max_new_tokens=1200,                  # Maximum length for generated response\n    use_cache=True,                        # Enable cache for efficient generation\n)\n\n# Decode the generated response from tokenized format to readable text\nresponse = tokenizer_testing.batch_decode(outputs)\n\n# Extract and print only the model's response part after \"### Response:\"\nprint(response[0].split(\"<Summary>\")[1].split(\"<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\")[0])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-12T19:07:41.037766Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-12T19:07:41.037978Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-12T19:07:44.378844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-12T19:07:41.037961Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-12T19:07:44.378198Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nEmily Carter saved her 78-year-old neighbor from a house fire .\nShe was walking home from school and noticed smoke coming from Mr. Fields' home .\nFirefighters arrived minutes later and extinguished the blaze .\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":35}]}
